Citations
---------

This work is derivative from a large number of shared dotfile repos used as
resources and inspiration.

The framework is based on [Dotbot][dotbot] and forked from the [Dotbot
Template][fork]. I surveyed a large number of "dotfile frameworks", and
chose DotBot for its clean and simple design and limited lock-in.

The dotfiles leverage other projects:

* [Base16 Color][base16]
* [Prezto ZSH][prezto]
* [Powerline Fonts][powerline]

Additional dotfile projects used for source and/or inspiration:

* [Holman's Dotfiles][holman_dotfiles]
* [Skwp's YDAR Dotfiles][yadr_dotfiles]
